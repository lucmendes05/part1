<h2> part1 </h2>

<p> 
before you close those curtains, <br>
before you flick that light off,  <br>
do not forget to be reminded by <br>
the trail you leave behind; <br><br>
     
fearfully and wonderfully made, <br>     
the stars bend down to greet you, <br>
in a moment, a closed eye, <br>
aligned with each dimension, <br> 
rocked gently away; <br><br>

never more comfortable to be quiet, <br> 
still, and silent, <br> 
the curls of smoke rise to frame your face, <br>
you slip away to some secluded place; <br><br>

i think that i will be travelling for a lifetime, <br>
changing the path, the future for the benefit of the past, <br>
seeing doors that open and close and fall <br>
under the weight of things i could not amend, <br><br> 
     
please do not be too tired to breathe, <br>
the squares will blend, spill over <br> 
hidden in reflections of his analyses, <br> 
may you never be alone; <br><br> 
     
when you open those curtains, <br>
just as you flick that light on, <br> 
do not forget to be reminded by <br> 
the day you have ahead.
